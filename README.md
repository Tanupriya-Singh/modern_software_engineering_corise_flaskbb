# Welcome to Modern Software Engineering

This repository will be used to implement projects for the [Modern Software Engineering course on CoRise](corise.com/go/modern-se-R5J1C6). It is a fork of the [FlaskBB github project](https://github.com/flaskbb/flaskbb) which changes to make the repository more amenable as a teaching tool. You can find the original readme [here](https://github.com/navteniev/modern_software_engineering_corise_flaskbb/blob/main/ORIGINAL_README.md).

To get started with this repository fork it into your personal github account and add the course intructors and teaching assistants as contributors. (See the current sessions website for their github handles)

This repository and the course were designed to enable you to do all your work in the browser using Github Codespaces. If you've run into an issues with the setup and have a workaround, please create a pull request to this repository.
